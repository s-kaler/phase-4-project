# SoundFound Music Playlists

This project is a full stack application modeling an online music library with user authentication. In the frontend, Users can sign up and log in to access their profiles, where they can upload new songs and create new playlists. Users who are not logged in can view all artists and their playlists. Logging in allows users to add any songs from other artists. There is a search page that allows users to search for other artists, songs, and playlists.

In the backend, the API implementation shows a

## Updating Your README.md

`README.md` is a Markdown file that describes your project. These files can be
used in many different ways- you may have noticed that we use them to generate
entire Canvas lessons- but they're most commonly used as homepages for online
Git repositories. **When you develop something that you want other people to
use, you need to have a README.**

Markdown is not a language that we cover in Flatiron's Software Engineering
curriculum, but it's not a particularly difficult language to learn (if you've
ever left a comment on Reddit, you might already know the basics). Refer to the
cheat sheet in this lesson's resources for a basic guide to Markdown.

### What Goes into a README?

This README should serve as a template for your own- go through the important
files in your project and describe what they do. Each file that you edit (you
can ignore your migration files) should get at least a paragraph. Each function
should get a small blurb.

You should descibe your application first, and with a good level of detail. The
rest should be ordered by importance to the user. (Probably routes next, then
models.)

Screenshots and links to resources that you used throughout are also useful to
users and collaborators, but a little more syntactically complicated. Only add
these in if you're feeling comfortable with Markdown.

## Conclusion

A lot of work goes into a full-stack application, but it all relies on concepts
that you've practiced thoroughly throughout this phase. Hopefully this template
and guide will get you off to a good start with your Phase 4 Project.

Happy coding!
